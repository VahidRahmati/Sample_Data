# Sample_Data
This repository contains some sample in vitro data for CaBBI method (Rahmati. et al. 2016). 

Most of these data have been originally published in:

> **More information**:
In ([Rahmati et al. 2016](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004736)), we proposed a new method for calcium imaging analysis based on the biophysical models of spiking neurons and Bayesian inference; we called our method CaBBI. This method has been implemented as Matlab code in the VBA toolbox (http://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/), and is now publicly available as a part of this toolbox (http://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/wiki/CaBBI/).
